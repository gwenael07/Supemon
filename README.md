## Game Principles

Supemon is a **turn-based text RPG** where the player controls a trainer and a team of creatures called **Supemons**.

The game is divided into several areas:
- **The Wild**: fight random Supemons, earn XP and Supcoins, and attempt captures  
- **The Shop**: buy and sell items (potions, rare candies)  
- **The Supemon Center**: heal all Supemons for free  

Battles are turn-based. During a fight, the player can attack, switch Supemons, use items, run away, or try to capture the enemy.  
Attack success depends on accuracy and evasion, while speed affects turn order and escape chances.

Winning battles grants experience and allows Supemons to **level up and improve their stats**.  
The objective is to build a balanced team and progress through battles and captures.
